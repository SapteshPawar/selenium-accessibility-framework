# 🧪 Test Scenarios

## ✅ Scenario 1 — Accessibility Validation (Strict)

- Opens SauceDemo login page
- Runs accessibility scan
- Fails test if violations are found

---

## ✅ Scenario 2 — Accessibility Validation (Soft Assertion)

- Logs violations
- Allows execution to continue
- Demonstrates reporting flow

---

## ✅ Scenario 3 — Accessibility Scan After Login

- Performs login using:
  - Username: `standard_user`
  - Password: `secret_sauce`
- Navigates to Products page
- Runs accessibility scan after authentication
